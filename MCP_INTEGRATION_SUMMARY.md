I have successfully integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) into your CLM Automation System. This integration transforms your contract management system into an AI-agent-ready platform.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### ✅ Core MCP Components

1. **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`)
   - JSON-RPC protocol implementation
   - 9 specialized tools for contract management
   - Async/await architecture for scalability
   - Error handling and logging

2. **MCP Client** (`mcp_client.py`)
   - Python client for external AI tools
   - AI agent wrapper with automation capabilities
   - Connection management and error recovery

3. **Workflow Engine** (`mcp_integration.py`)
   - Multi-step workflow automation
   - Retry logic and dependency management
   - Orchestrator for complex operations

4. **Configuration System** (`mcp_config.py`)
   - Comprehensive configuration management
   - Environment variable support
   - Tool and workflow settings

5. **Examples & Documentation** (`mcp_examples.py`, `MCP_INTEGRATION.md`)
   - Comprehensive usage examples
   - Complete documentation
   - Test suite validation

## 🛠️ Available MCP Tools

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. **Basic Usage**
```python
from mcp_client import CLMMCPClient
import asyncio

async def main():
    client = CLMMCPClient()
    await client.start_server()
    
    # Ask a question about contracts
    result = await client.ask_question("What contracts are expiring soon?")
    print(result['answer'])
    
    await client.stop_server()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 2. **AI Agent Usage**
```python
from mcp_client import CLMAIAgent

async def main():
    agent = CLMAIAgent(CLMMCPClient())
    await agent.initialize()
    
    # Analyze contracts
    analysis = await agent.analyze_contracts("conflicts")
    print(f"Found {analysis.get('count', 0)} conflicts")
    
    await agent.shutdown()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 3. **Workflow Automation**
```python
from mcp_integration import CLMAutomationOrchestrator

async def main():
    orchestrator = CLMAutomationOrchestrator()
    await orchestrator.initialize()
    
    # Run daily automation
    result = await orchestrator.run_daily_automation()
    print(f"Status: {result['workflow_result']['status']}")
    
    await orchestrator.shutdown()

asyncio.run(main())
```
