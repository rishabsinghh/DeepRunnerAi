Subject: Contract Amendment Discussion
Date: June 15, 2024

Hi Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our discussion about the service agreement amendment.

As we discussed in our meeting last week, we need to address a few items:

1. The monthly retainer increase from $15,000 to $18,000
2. The new cloud migration services you'll be providing
3. The extended contract term through June 2025

I've attached the draft amendment for your review. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Also, I noticed there's a discrepancy in our address information. Our legal team wants to ensure we have the correct address on file. Could you confirm which address should be used for official correspondence?

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
John Smith
CEO, TechCorp Solutions

Hi John,

Thanks for the follow-up. I've reviewed the amendment and everything looks good to me.

Regarding the address discrepancy, I apologize for the confusion. Our official business address is 456 Business Ave, New York, NY 10002. The other address in some of our contracts is our old location that we moved from last year.

I'll have our legal team update all our contracts with the correct address information.

The amendment looks good to proceed. When would you like to schedule the signing?

Best,
Sarah Johnson
VP Operations, Global Industries Ltd
