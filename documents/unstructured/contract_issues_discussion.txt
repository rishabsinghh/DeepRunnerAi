Contract Issues Discussion - Internal Notes

Problems we're facing:

1. Address conflicts everywhere
- TechCorp has 2 different addresses in our system
- Global Industries also has conflicting addresses
- This is causing confusion in billing and legal docs

2. Date inconsistencies
- Some contracts show different expiration dates
- Not sure which version is correct
- Need to verify with original signed copies

3. Missing metadata
- Half our contracts don't have proper metadata
- Makes searching and filtering difficult
- Need to standardize this going forward

4. Renewal tracking
- Manual process is error-prone
- Missed a renewal deadline last quarter
- Need automated alerts

5. Version control nightmare
- Multiple versions of same contract
- Not clear which is current
- Need better document management

Solutions to consider:
- Implement contract management system
- Use AI to extract and standardize data
- Set up automated renewal alerts
- Create single source of truth for contract data

Priority: HIGH - These issues are affecting business operations
